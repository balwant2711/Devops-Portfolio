## 🧑‍💻 **About Me**

I am a Cloud & DevOps Engineer focused on building scalable infrastructure, automating workflows, and delivering robust cloud solutions. My work emphasizes:

* Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using **Terraform**
* AWS architecture & deployment
* CI/CD pipeline development
* Server automation & orchestration
* Python-based backend utilities
* Linux administration & shell scripting
* Containerization & modern DevOps tooling

This portfolio highlights both my technical depth and practical problem-solving approach in cloud infrastructure engineering.
